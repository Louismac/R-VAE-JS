# R-VAE-JS
R-VAE on the browser: https://vigliensoni.github.io/R-VAE-JS/

Based on [Nao Tokui's RhythmVAE](https://github.com/naotokui/RhythmVAE_M4L)

Currently only working in Firefox.

To create distribution

``` bash
npm run build
```


After webpack is executed all the required components will be packaged and ready to be used in the `dist` folder.

The demo running on Github is served from the `docs` folder, and so the contents from `dist` have to be copied over.
